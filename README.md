## Bootstrap4
This is the most popular framework. So u can find many articles and stackoverflow help. Also it's documentation is awesome.  
But its JavaScript components require dependencies 1. `jQuery` 2. `Popper` which may lead to slow load and less performance grade.  
`bootstrap.bundle.js` include popper.  
It have a good grid system. if you only want the grid system u can use `bootstrap.grid.css`.  
Bootstrap reboot the css for u. if you only want to reboot css u can use `bootstrap.reboot.css`.
Bootstrap comes with handful of components which do not lag in uses.  
But some JavaScript components are not there like parallax.  
Bootstrap gives a simple class based code. which is good that I don't want to write more HTMl or JavaScript for a simple thing.  

Bootstrap can be a perfect choice if i just want the CSS components.  
JavaScript components are fairly good but i don't like dependencies and generally I prefer to write in pure JavaScript.  
Overall it is good choice.

```
Bootstrap is good for CSS components.
JavaScript components are not too good and comes with dependencies
