## [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com)
This is the most popular framework. So u can find many articles and stackoverflow help. Also it's documentation is awesome.  
But its JavaScript components require dependencies 1. `jQuery` 2. `Popper` which may lead to slow load and less performance grade.  
`bootstrap.bundle.js` include popper.  
It have a good grid system. if you only want the grid system u can use `bootstrap.grid.css`.  
Bootstrap reboot the css for u. if you only want to reboot css u can use `bootstrap.reboot.css`.
Bootstrap comes with handful of components which do not lag in uses.  
But some JavaScript components are not there like parallax.  
Bootstrap gives a simple class based code. which is good that I don't want to write more HTMl or JavaScript for a simple thing.  

Bootstrap can be a perfect choice if i just want the CSS components.  
JavaScript components are fairly good but i don't like dependencies and generally I prefer to write in pure JavaScript.  
Overall it is good choice.

```
Bootstrap is good for CSS components.
JavaScript components are not too good and comes with dependencies
```

## [MDL by Google](https://getmdl.io)
By the name it look like it is the best framework. But the truth is it is not it is a below average framework.  
The First thing is its class structure the name  of classes are very long and often leads to typo.  
The second is the performance grade. Its Lighthouse audit scores comes to very low as compared to other framework.  
I am not sure about the browser compatibility but some of its components uses components which is only supported by Chrome. Also some of the component require extra plugins which will then take you to load slow.  
There are some basic components missing like Select. Extra installation is needed for those component.  
Many times i have seen that the components are not enough responsive on small screen.   
It have good colour scheme so it don't offers extra classes for theme which is good because major sites goes with 2 colour theme.  

```
MDL is not probably the choice u should make.
Go for other framework based on Material design instead
