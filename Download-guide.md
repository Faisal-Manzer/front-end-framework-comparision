# WEB Download What Why How?
If you are going to start web development you surely need tools.  
As for beginners, it is quite difficult to know all what why how to download.

- `Text Editors`
  web development is based on simple text files.  
  To just get a start you can use `notepad ( windows )` but is not effective and will create a hassle  

  - [Atom](https://atom.io/) **cross platform**.
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)  **cross platform**.
  
Text editor works at one file at a time they will also suggest you code but are not much powerful.

- `IDEs` : **beginners please you text editors** for some time. IDEs, unlike text editor, works on whole project or folder. They automatically compile codes and show advanced error and warning. IDEs are very powerful and will make you dependent on it. they are for the advanced user who has enough knowledge.

    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) **FREE cross platform IDE** by Microsoft.
    - [WebStrom](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download) **cross platform** by JetBrains. **My favroite**.  
    **Free for students**.  [Register here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) for avialing student discount. You just need _university ID Card_ or _university mail id_.
    - [PhpStrom](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/) specialized in PHP.  **cross platform** by JetBrains. **My favroite**.  
    **Free for students**.  [Register here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) for avialing student discount. You just need _university ID Card_ or _university mail id_.
    
- `Browsers`
    - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) USE CHROME AS DEFAULT DEVELOPMENT BROWSER. I would recommend using Chrome for web dev. It packs with best developer tools.
    - [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Second best option.

    All the below are not for development they are just for testing purpose. As a web developer, you need to test for the majority of cross browsers issue. Recommended to install all the browsers listed here.
    - [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)
    - Edge - pre-installed on Windows
    - Internet Explorer -  pre-installed on Windows - yes you need this is want to cover all types of audience.
    - Safari  pre-installed on Mac

- `Server`: server is needed to run many things like PHP, Python, etc. They are needed for backend part.
    - `For Mac and Windows` [mamp](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) **Recommended for basic use and will work out of box**
    Supports PHP, Python, Perl. Have inbuilt MySQL server. Supports both apache and nginx. 
    - `Linux, Windows, Mac` [lamp](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer) same specs as mamp.
    - `Windows` **wamp**. Download link not available. Sorry :) Search Google.
    - [xamp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) **Cross-platform**, advanced

- `Technology`
    - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
    
    in simple words, node is just another server-side language which uses javascript as language and is async.

    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) git is a decentralized version control system which you will learn later. But for now, download it. Git runs on command line.

    Git has nothing to do with Web. It is for all languages or anything you want.
    - [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) based on git there is a community called GitHub it gives space for repos online. ( there are more like BigBucket etc, but GitHub is most used and you should use it too ). 
    
    as git is a command line tool. Github Desktop provides a GUI for git. use when you are beginners but try to learn git command line as soon as possible. 
    
- `Image Editor` use the one you like. Simple image editor like [photoscape](https://photoscape.en.softonic.com/download) will do your task.

- `Chrome Extentions` yes they will help you lot.
	- [TabMan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabman-tabs-manager/hgmnkflcjcohihpdcniifjbafcdelhlm) is helpfull when you will search lots and lots of stuffs all in a new tab and now you are left with just favicon of page. TabMan comes in resque. I use it a lot.
	- [Chrome Web Server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) a simple web server by Chrome.
	- [Grammerly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen) is my love. it corrects all the spelling and gramitical mistakes in an article
