# WEB Download What Why How?
If you are going to start web development you surely need tools.  
As for beginners it is quite difficult to know all what why how to download.

- `Text Editors`
  web development is based of simple text files.  
  To just get a start you can use `notepad ( windows )` but is not effective and will create a hassle  

  - [Atom](https://atom.io/) **cross platform**.
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)  **cross platform**.
  
Text editor works at one file at atime they will also suggest you code but are not much powerful.

- `IDEs` : **beginners please you text editors** for some time. IDEs unlike text editor works on whole project or folder. They automatically complie codes and show advanced error and warning. IDEs are very powerfull and will make you dependent on it. they are for advanced user who have enough knowledge.

	- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) **FREE cross platform IDE** by Microsoft.

	- [PhpStrom](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/) specialized in PHP.  **cross platform** by JetBrains. **My favroite**.

- `Browsers`
	- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) USE CHROME AS DEFAULT DEVELOPMENT BROWSER. I would recommend to use Chrome for webdev. It pack with best developer tools.
	- [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Second best option.

	All the below are not for development they are just for testing purpose. As a web developer you need to test for majorty of cross browsers issue. Recommended to install all the browers listed here.
	- [Opera]
